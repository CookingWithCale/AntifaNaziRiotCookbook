Today we will be working on the McCollough vs Portland State University first-amendment clear and convincing evidence lawsuit.

PSU kicked me out using a preponderance of teh evidence for telling off the vaccine police while they were enforcing the illagl vaccine mandate claiming that disrupte the health clinic staff.

Since Supreme Court ruling Troxel v Graneville in 2001, you have a right to use of clear and convincing evidence to deprive you of your First Amdnment rights.

I'm suing PSU to defend free speech and I'm live streaming the lawsuit worksessions and I'm hoping to find domations for an attorney, feedback and help with the lawsuit paperwork.
